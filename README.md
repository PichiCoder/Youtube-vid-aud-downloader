# Youtube-vid-aud-downloader
Very modest script to download Videos and/or Audio from youtube using pytube and moviepy.
This is my first serious/"useful" project. I am aware that it must have plenty of room for improvement. ItÂ´s not something new but i wanted to give it a try. It seemed doable despite my non-existent experience in coding a full program. I entered this world with python and i wanted to face a real but relatively-easy project.
