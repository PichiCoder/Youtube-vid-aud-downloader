# Youtube-vid-aud-downloader
Very modest script to download Videos and/or Audio from youtube using pytube and moviepy.
This is my first serious/"useful" project. I am aware that the code must have a lot to improve. Besides its not something new but i wanted to give it a try. It seemed doable despite my non-experience. I entered the programming world with python and i wanted to face a real and relatively-easy project, considering that i only know the basics and a bit more perhaps.
